# Comparison

## `==`

`==` is the operator used to check if the left and right operands are of equal value. It returns a `upcore:types.bit`.

### Example

```up
_ = 5 == 6;       ~ false
_ = "hi" == "hi"; ~ true
```

## `!=`

`!=` is just the opposite of `==`.

### Example

```up
_ = 5 != 6;       ~ true
_ = "hi" != "hi"; ~ false
```

## `>`

`>` checks if the left operand is greater than the right one. Returns `upcore:types.bit`.

### Example

```up
_ = 5 > 6; ~ false
_ = 7 > 1; ~ true
```

## `<`

Less than. Should be self explanatory to be honest you already have an example of how this doesnt work up there. ^

## `>=`

Greater than or equal to.

## `<=`

Less than or equal to.
